# Avoid Falling
"Avoid Falling" is an isometric small action game where the player controls a green ball. The goal is to avoid being pushed off the platform by the enemy balls. This game is based on prototype 4 from the Junior Programmer Pathway from the Unity Learn Platform. Since it is mainly a learning experience, the game design and gameplay remain basic.
